A RMOR
Armor increases your six defenses. Light, medium, and
heavy armor, as well as shields, all follow the same basic
principles.
DEFENSES
Defense Defense Score
Armor Rating (AR) 10
Reflexes (REF) 10 + DEX
Fortitude (FORT) 10 + END
Anticipation (ANT) 10 + AWR
Logic (LOG) 10 + INT
Willpower (WILL) 10 + CHA
Your defenses, by default, are listed on the table above. Each
of these numbers might be modified by the armor that you
choose to wear.
On the Armor tables below, each type of armor specifies
your new AR, as well as listing modifiers to the five defenses
that are based on your attributes.
STR, DEX, AND SPEED
Some medium armor and all heavy armor have a STR
minimum, a DEX maximum, and a speed modifier.
If you don armor and your STR is less than the STR
minimum, your Speed becomes 0 and you gain the Dazed
condition.
While wearing armor with a DEX maximum, your DEX
cannot exceed that number; if your DEX was higher than
that number, it is reduced to the DEX maximum while
wearing such armor. This affects your REF defense.
If you have a speed modifier from your armor, apply it
to the distance that you can move each time you spend AP.
There are talents that can reduce this penalty.
R E S I S TA N C E
SPECIALIZATION
The Resist column on the armor allows you to apply Resist
to certain kinds of damage, but you cannot do so unless you
have taken a Second Skin talent that allows you to unlock
this added bonus.
H E AV Y A R M O R
Heavy armor has the unwieldy tag when carrying it, but not
while wearing it.
SHIELDS
Each Shield has the one-handed tag. While using a shield,
you can only wield light weapons in your other hand,
although talents can remove this restriction.
BARDING
You can purchase barding, or specialized armor, for an
animal. This can be any armor besides shields. Barding
costs twice the normal sc of armor if the animal is Medium
or smaller. It costs four times the normal sc if the animal is
Large, and eight times the sc if Huge. Creatures larger than
Huge cannot have barding unless the MC decides otherwise.

TOWER SHIELD
Tower shields have the two-handed and unwieldy tags. Rather than improving your AR or your other defenses, tower shields
grant you Total Cover on one side.
You may spend 2 AP to brace the shield, which grants Partial Cover to a creature standing directly behind you, provided that
the creature is your Size or smaller.
