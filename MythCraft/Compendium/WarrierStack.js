longDescription: "Your path to becoming the warrior you are today was one of absolute discipline.At a young age you were a gifted athlete, playing in children’s sports or getting into trouble pushing back against authority.As you grew, your restlessness matured into a desire to protect those weaker than you.Guided by great blademasters, you learned your way around sword and spear, shield and bow.As a versatile fighter, you are almost equally capable with any weapon and any suit of armor, making you an invaluable soldier. You also have a keen mind for battle tactics and act with disciplined measure as you direct your foes away from your weaker allies. What motivates you when you don your armor? What thoughts stick with you as you draw your weapons and slog into the battlefield? How do your driving goals inform your fighting style? If you are motivated by vengeance, you might be an especially merciless fighter, whereas if you desire to protect your loved ones, you might stay your blade when you have the opportunity to do an enemy in, letting compassion guide your hand as much as justice.Maybe you have no scruples at all and will simply do what is asked of you as long as the coins keep coming.",
