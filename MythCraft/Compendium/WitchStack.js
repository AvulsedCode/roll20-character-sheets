longDescription: "Signs that you were somehow different began at an early age.Animals and plants might behave strangely around you, either shying away or seeking to embrace you.Odd weather phenomena seem to follow you about, though perhaps this is coincidence.Whatever the case, the adults in your community noticed these strange behaviors.In your adolescence you felt a growing connection with the dark and strange side of nature, leading you to look for answers on your own.When a coven of witches found you and invited you into their ranks, you began to truly master your powers. Witches often have many hobbies and one or two crafts that they pursue to perfection.What are you most interested in, and what do you fiddle with in your spare time? Does the ephemeral quality of music fascinate you, or are you more inclined to get your hands dirty making pottery or whittling toys? Are you more interested in brewing potions or training your familiar to achieve its maximum potential?",
