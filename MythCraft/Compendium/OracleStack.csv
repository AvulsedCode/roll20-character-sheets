    longDescription: "Born under a unique configuration of Ancerra’s five moons, you were destined for mystic greatness.As a child you possessed an innate sensitivity to people’s emotional states and to the natural world around you, and often you felt that unsettling sense that you knew something would happen before the fact, and it came to pass precisely as you had expected.This led you to seek the counsel of an experienced mystic who taught you the ways of oracular prophecy. Embracing your role as a link between the physical and the spiritual, you have yourself become an enigmatic guide to those who seek prophetic vision. Regardless of how accurate you are, you may be called upon frequently to predict the future.Give some thought to how you feel about such requests.Do you believe that you can actually divine the future on command, or do you think that such visions are only occasionally gifted to you? Is it a skill you can get better at, or just an innate knack you possess? Furthermore, what kind of physical props, such as tarot cards or animal bones, do you use when attempting such soothsaying?",
