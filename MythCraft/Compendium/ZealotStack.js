    longDescription: "You have always been a serious person. As a child you took playing with a somber gravity and it greatly upset you when another child broke the rules.In your adolescence you were often dismayed by the lackadaisical nature of your contemporaries.At some point along the way, you found a cause to which you dedicated your very soul.This transformation has led you to seek out a sacred order or deity to whom you have pledged your allegiance. You now strive to undertake acts of selflessness and zeal for the betterment of the world in accordance with the tenets of your faith. You are undoubtedly dedicated to your beliefs with keen resolve.How do you approach those who do not share your convictions? Do you seek to persuade folk to adopt your tenets as their own, or do you try to learn the beliefs of other creatures and the reasons behind those beliefs? Maybe you engage in a mix of both approaches.",
