  longDescription: "You grew up in a rough neighborhood and had been in more than your fair share of street fights by the time you were a teen.Forged and tempered by your brutal environment, you are familiar with the necessity of fighting over scraps of food and the agony of gnawing hunger and broken ribs after losing such a fight.But you remained determined to persevere despite innumerable hardships.Through sheer will to survive, unwavering grit, and bloody fists, you became a powerful unarmed combatant, capable of going toe to toe even with skilled warriors that fight with sword or spear. Your skill in unarmed combat is unquestioned and your style distinct.Do you rely on your overwhelmingly powerful physique to crush your foes? Maybe you fight with an unpredictable blend of strength and agility, or you might rigorously train in various forms that you can use to outmaneuver enemies with different fighting styles.Whatever your personal blend of unarmed combat maneuvers, you quickly cultivate a reputation among other fighters for your skill at holding your own against armed combatants.",

longDescription: "You have always had a spark of talent within you, perhaps the ability to literally conjure forth sparks when agitated or excited.Ever curious about the world and the power within you, you have never shied away from experimentation with your magical powers.In your youth this caused your family endless grief and singed eyebrows.Now, having mastered the basics of arcane magic, you seek to continue your study and uncover ever deeper mysteries of the Fundamental Wellspring of Magic. Developing skill as an arcane caster necessitates that you maintain Attunation with the Fundamental Wellspring. This entails different practices for different casters, so in your case it might involve reading complex arcane texts or meditating intensely on the metaphysics or astrophysics of the universe.Be proactive, for if you become lackadaisical in maintaining Attunation, your skill will gradually atrophy, and you might lose your arcane ability altogether if you do not diligently cultivate this Attunation.",
