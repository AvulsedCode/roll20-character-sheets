longDescription: "You have never been able to keep from fidgeting, always reaching for clockwork, screws, wires, and the like as you seek to create new inventions or improve upon existing ones. You always had a penchant for tinkering and exhibit relentless ingenuity. You quickly gained notoriety as someone who could always find a way to enhance anything with mechanical parts.Unquenchably curious, you always seek to understand how something works and how it might be improved upon. What is your medium of choice? Tinkerers often favor metal and wood due to their versatility, but other substances can make for interesting inventions as well.When you invent something, what motivates you? Are you most concerned with improving your quality of life by making existing technology more effective, or are you looking to break the confines of science as your contemporaries understand it? Do you have some grand idea for a new invention that will revolutionize the world?",
