shortDescription: "By siphoning power from gods and other planar entities, vessels augment their own souls for monumental powerâ€¦ but at terrible cost.",

longDescription: "You have always known that something is not right with the world.Deity and demon alike seem utterly concerned with their own plans and care not for the mortal world. In response, you have grown increasingly bitter and have finally taken it upon yourself to rewrite the world as you see fit.By siphoning power from gods and planar entities, you will become a god in your own right, and will act with more justice and care than any before you. Being a vessel is a dangerous affair. You are constantly stealing traces of power from tremendous, unfathomable planar entities.In so doing, you run the risk of their retaliation.How do you recognize your own role in the grand scheme of the cosmos? Do you steal power with a sense of resignation that one day you will be caught and punished, or do you boldly believe that eventually you might become as powerful as a demigod yourself? Do you steal from many different gods to hide your tracks, or do you find yourself returning to the same deity over and over? Would you ever enter into some form of mutual agreement with a deity in exchange for a reliable stream of power, or is this too limiting for your aspirations? What exactly do you hope to achieve from taking godly power into your own hands? If you pursue some kind of abstract moral goal, how will you know when you have achieved it? How much power do you need from the gods in order to achieve this goal, and is there truly no safer way to do so ? Or, maybe you steal from the gods just because you like it.",
