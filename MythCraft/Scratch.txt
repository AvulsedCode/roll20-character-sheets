PLAINS ELF
Many elves were drawn to wide open plains and deserts where the sky stretched from horizon to horizon. Here, nomadic elven tribes hunted and gathered and built powerful connections with the herds of wild horses, camels, and the like that frequented these places. They also came into regular, and often bloody, contact with brutish raiders and brigands, perfecting the arts of open combat across generations. Elves hailing from the desert or plains gain the following two features at 1st level.
